              JavaScript is like my second language in web development. My Python is
              much better. In a similar way to a native English speaker trying to speak
              secondary school French, if I were to try to resolve a coding challenge in
              JavaScript, I would think of the code in Python first and then try to
              translate that into JavaScript.

              Although syntactically different, I have developed a couple of toy projects
              in React which uses a syntax called JSX. React seems more expressive and
              intuitive to use than pure JavaScript, although ES6 syntax has
              improved JavaScript a lot in that regard. I enjoy programming in React and
              am looking forward to learn more of it.

              I can often develop enough with JavaScript to write small scripts that
              supplement the use of my website. Again, there are a lot of examples of sprinklings
              of JavaScript throughout the portfolio that augment its functionality.
