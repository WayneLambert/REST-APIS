# Counting

The word/letter counting app is a demonstration of using Python to calculate the number of occurrences of each of the words and letters used within the string input/pasted by the user. No models are required for this app, however Django's view handles the request/response cycle and the rendering of the applicable context is handled using a Django template.

There is also some mathematical calculations which specify the rate if any given letter appearing within the text being evaluated.

To save time, uou can import some 'lorem ipsum' text instead of typing or copying/pasting.

**Note:** No data is recorded within the application and the text used does not appear in any analytics.
