This app is a simulation of the popular letters game on the British TV show countdown.

A letters game is one of the ten rounds during a 15 round game in which the contestant chooses 9 letters by selecting either a vowel or a consonant until there is a total of 9 letters. The player can choose the letters in any order, but the selection must include at least 4 consonants and 3 vowels, hence there are only three valid choices in modern Countdown: 3 vowels, 6 consonants; 4 vowels, 5 consonants; and 5 vowels, 4 consonants.

When the show was first broadcast, and for a number of years, contestants could choose as many vowels and consonants as they liked, which often led to poor selections where only 4's and 5's were available. Since then the rules have been changed. In the original 9-round format, there were six letters games; the "original" 15 round format used from 2001 to 2013 featured eleven letters games, with the contestant in the champion's chair receiving one extra pick.

A player scores points on a letters game by writing down a valid word within the 30 seconds. This word must be in the current New Oxford English Dictionary, but not a proper noun, nor an abbreviation. Players can use each letter only as many times as it appears in the selection. For example, from the selection EEEECDLST, a player could offer SELECTED, using three of the four available E's. Words score 1 point per letter, except for nine-letter words which are worth 18.

After the contestants have offered their solution, Dictionary Corner offer a few more words which either equal or beat whatever the contestants have offered. Dictionary Corner is usually made up of Susie Dent and a celebrity guest, helped by Damian Eadie who communicates the answers to Susie via an earpiece.

Based on the pool of letters used in Series 66 (typical of most recent series), and disregarding the ordering of the letters, there are a total of 9,719,199 different possible letters games. Among all possible nine-letter words that can be formed from this pool, WAKIZASHI is the least likely to be available.
