# Portfolio Project

This site is hosted at <https://waynelambert.dev> and illustrates the use of Django apps to showcase Django, Python and other programming and web framework skills and technologies.

The blog is not intended to be a fully blown production product, therefore some typical blog features have been purposefully omitted. For example, comments and tags are additional features that could be developed for the blog.

## Django Blog

- [Home Page](https://waynelambert.dev/blog)
- [README](https://github.com/WayneLambert/portfolio/tree/master/blog)

The content of the blog itself is about various topics in computer programming and web development. The posts are intended to demonstrate my understanding of the topics in addition to my own learning and documentation for specific processes that I am likely to need again when I integrate them in future projects.

## Django Rest Framework API Endpoints

- [API Endpoints](https://www.waynelambert.dev/api/blog/posts/)
- [README](https://github.com/WayneLambert/portfolio/tree/master/api)

## React Blog

COMING SOON: This project is not yet available online.

- [README](https://github.com/WayneLambert/portfolio/tree/master/aa-front-end)

**Note:** I am favouring the development of more complete test coverage for the project in addition to bolstering up the portfolio with additional projects.

This is likely to be completed in the intermediate term.
