This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

This was created at an earlier stage in the project when I was using React for the
front end and picking up the data for the blog from the REST endpoints created with
Django Rest Framework.

At some point in the future, I may choose to develop another application and use
DRF and React.

I have kept this in view on the repo as an example for how to structure a project
that has a distinct back end and front end as well as having some examples of React
code an package management with npm.
