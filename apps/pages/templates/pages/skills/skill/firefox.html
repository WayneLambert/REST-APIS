              Firefox Developer Tools help me to diagnose many issues relating to web development
              including the loading of pages and assets, divs and CSS styling of web components,
              flexible layout across devices. Chrome Dev Tools seems to get all the plaudits,
              however I prefer Firefox's Dev Tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have learned a lot about web development through Dev Tools alone by the
              inspection of websites that achieve a desired outcome. It is usually possible to
              reverse engineer the front-end build of a website through inspection and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to its instant feedback, I often find myself making small HTML and CSS
              adjustments within the Dev Tools to achieve the outcome I desire and then
              cement that into my HTML or Sass file afterwards. The Django development browser
              doesn't have hot module reloading like React due to React's Virtual DOM feature.

              One Firefox extension that I would give a shout out to is 'Fake Filler'.
              It makes filling out forms a "one-click" process which is very
              useful for testing forms with many inputs. It can be programmed with regex
              to control how the forms are filled in. During the development process,
              you may need to fill out forms dozens of times to test it in different ways
              and typing in example input over and over again becomes tedious. Yes, writing
              unit tests is another way to accomplish this but sometimes seeing forms working
              trumps a unit test.
