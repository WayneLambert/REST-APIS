# Text Analysis

The text analysis app is a demonstration of using Python to calculate the number of occurrences of each of the words and letters used within the string input/pasted by the user. No models are required for this app, however Django's views handles the request/response cycle and the rendering of the applicable context is handled using a Django template.

There are also some mathematical calculations for the rate of any given letter appearing within the text being evaluated.

To save time, you can import some _'lorem ipsum'_ text instead of typing or copying/pasting.

## Features

- Uses Python lists to store results from logic
- Uses Pythonic for [each] loop to iterate over every letter of the alphabet to test for presence
- Creates a context dictionary with several elements used within the Django template to give the user rich information about the text they would like to examine

## Technologies Used

- Languages: Python, HTML / CSS
- Frameworks: Django, Bootstrap, FontAwesome
- Other: GitHub, Docker

**<u>Data Protection Notice</u>:** No data is recorded within the application and the text used does not appear in any analytics.
