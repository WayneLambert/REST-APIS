![Python Django Portfolio Blog](https://wl-portfolio.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/python-django-portfolio-github.png)

This site is hosted at <https://waynelambert.dev> and illustrates the use of Django apps to showcase Django, Python and other programming and web framework skills and technologies.

The blog is not intended to be a fully blown production product, therefore some typical blog features have been purposefully omitted. For example, comments and tags are additional features that could be developed for the blog.

## Django Blog

A full CRUD application using Django's models, views, and templates.

- [Home Page](https://waynelambert.dev/blog)
- [README](https://github.com/WayneLambert/portfolio/tree/master/blog)

The content of the blog itself is about various topics in computer programming and web development. The posts are intended to demonstrate my understanding of the topics in addition to my own learning and documentation for specific processes that I am likely to need again when I integrate them in future projects.
