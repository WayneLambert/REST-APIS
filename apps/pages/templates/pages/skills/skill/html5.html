              HTML is the front-end markup language that I have the most comfort with since
              I have been using it in some sense since the days of Microsoft FrontPage and
              Adobe DreamWeaver.
            </p>

              I can quickly write HTML due to VS Code's built-in Emmet support which
              enables markup to be written quickly using the many Emmet commands.
            </p>

              I have a good working knowledge of lists, tables, divs, paragraphs,
              formatting elements, blocks, images and links.

              When used with classes and ids, I can usually style a website how I would like
              it to look, given the time to do so. I will be first to admit that this
              can often be the most frustrating side of building a website. If you've
              ever spent several hours researching and attempting to move an element a
              couple of pixels, then you'll know what I mean!
