              I am a proficient power-user of the terminal. The high majority of my
              terminal knowledge is Unix-based (Mac and Ubuntu), so I believe my knowledge
              in the Windows terminal is more limited. I know a lot of the commands are
              similar but don't know the differences between the operating systems.
              WSL somewhat compensates for that, however, I much prefer to do my development on a Mac.
            </p>
            <p>
              To varying degrees, I can use the terminal for package management with tools
              like 'brew', 'pip', 'pyenv', 'poetry', 'conda', 'npm', and 'pipenv'.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can create some shell scripts to automate some frequently repeated processes,
              although I would lean towards using Python where possible to perform scripting tasks.
