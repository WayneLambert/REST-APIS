                The Countdown Letters project uses the logic from the letters game on Countdown to enable a player
                to play against the computer (which I call Susie) attempting to get the longest word that they can.

            Unlike the TV game show, there is no 30 second clock. This is intended so that recruiters
            and hiring managers don't have to wait for a countdown timer to expire. I could build in
            a JavaScript countdown timer if I wanted to have this functionality.

        <!-- Project Objectives -->
        <div class="project-section mb-5">
          <h3 class="section-title font-weight-bold mb-2" id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
          <p>
            The idea for simulating this game came when I had previously used a dataset that I
            obtained from Kaggle.com when I was doing some data science analysis when learning
            Pandas. It was a list of 113,809 English words, so I wondered if I could build a
            simulation of the Countdown Letters game using the word list.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project Approach / Solution -->
        <div class="project-section mb-5">
          <h3 class="section-title font-weight-bold mb-2" id="approach-and-solution">The Approach &amp; Solution</h3>
          <p>
            My opening goal was to build something that was far simpler than the final product turned out. It was originally designed with the intention of just having a player's word and a computer's answer, however as I thought about the game show's format, I wondered if I could somehow integrate a definition for the game's word when the results of the game are displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This led me to research an API for a dictionary and discover the Oxford Dictionary API which
            allows me to have 1,000 requests per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            I inspected the API using a Jupyter Notebook (the best method I have found yet) and discovered
            that I would need to perform additional game validation such as confirming that the word chosen
            by the player appears in the dictionary.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would also need to retrieve the dictionary definition within the results page.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote out all of the validations that would be required in English and then proceeded
            to write individual functions that would fulfil each individual validation.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a later stage, following redevelopment of my portfolio, I refactored the project
            extracting the functions and classes into separate files depending upon whether they
            were genuine Django views, game logic functions, or validations. This seemed like a
            sensible approach to refactor the game's code making it more maintainable in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have an idea whereby I will capture the results of the game and post that data back
            to the database to record the details about each of the games that are played.
