# Portfolio Actions

- [ ] Sort out the header navigation routes
- [ ] Add a static page for my CV

- [ ] Add a third icon for usefulness which is upvotes - downvotes
- [ ] Add fields into the database to allow for the upvotes and downvotes
- [ ] Correct the post form so that it uses the post method
- [ ] Correct the post detail pages so that they use the put method


### Home Page

- Should include an up-to-date photo of myself

- Invite the viewer to view a detailed page of my self-learning journey

### Blog Project

- Home page of the blog project (/blog) should show a list of all of my blog posts. Whilst testing, these are just a list of the various Python PEPs. Later on in the project, I will replace this content with actual content which will form some useful 'know-how' content
