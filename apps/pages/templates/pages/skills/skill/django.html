              Having developed several projects in Django including the whole of the portfolio that
              you're currently reviewing, I have developed significant skills with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although nowadays I have starter projects to kickstart quickly, I can efficiently
              build a site from scratch using Django and overcome many of the obstacles in
              Django that the community considers to be advanced usage. Examples include:
              <ul class="mb-0 no-bullets">
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Creation of a custom authentication system subclassing from either <em>AbstractUser</em> or <em>AbstractBaseUser</em>.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Use and configure <em>Django-allauth</em> which is the de facto standard for any projects that
                  uses something other than Djangoâ€™s default username/password authentication pattern.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  The use of Celery/Redis to run many complex automated scheduled tasks.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Know the class-based views API extremely well including the use of higher-level classes
                  to abstract logic for subsequent child views. In my opinion, this makes the views more reusable and extensible.
                  Included within this, I also know how to include multiple forms per web page or process multiple
                  forms within a single class based view. I understand advanced concepts such as inheritance including multiple
                  inheritance and MRO.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Advanced configuration of Django models including the use of constraints, metadata,
                  managers, instance and class methods.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Advanced form design and features such as front-end JavaScript validation feedback in addition
                  to server-side checks and message rendering. Building of forms using ordinary Django forms,
                  Crispy Forms, Django Widget Tweaks, or integrating raw Boostrap HTML.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Efficient querying of the database using the ORM. This includes setting up model
                  managers throughout the project to retrieve related objects efficiently and reuse
                  common querysets throughout.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Creation of custom mixins to simplify views logic with repitition.
                  For example, if all views within a project should only be accessed by
                  a logged in user that is associated with an account, then a custom mixin can be made
                  to combine the <em>LoginRequiredMixin</em> with the <em>UserPassesTestMixin</em>, thus
                  meaning the <em>test_func</em> method does not need to be repeated in each view.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Consume an external API or scrape content from the web and store that data within
                  the database. If necessary, also cleaning and manipulating the data.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Set up and use context processors for global context variables saving the
                  <em>get_context_data</em> method from being overridden many times.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw mr-2"></i>
                  Build a highly customised admin interface that could essentially be a fast
                  prototype of an application. This includes amendments to widget sizes, an
                  overridden HTML template and CSS amendments.
