              I am a proficient power-user of the terminal. The high majority of my
              terminal knowledge is in Mac and Ubuntu, so I don't believe that I know
              that much in Windows. I know a lot of the commands are similar but don't
              know the differences between the operating systems. WSL somewhat compensates
              for that, however, I much prefer to do my development on a Mac.
            </p>
            <p>
              To varying degrees, I can use the terminal for package management with tools
              like 'brew', 'pip', 'pyenv', 'pipenv', 'conda', 'npm', and 'poetry'.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can create some shell scripts to automate some frequently repeated processes.
