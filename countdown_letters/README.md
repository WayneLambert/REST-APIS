# Countdown Letters Game

The countdown project uses the logic from the letters game on Countdown to enable a player to play against the computer attempting to get the longest word that they can.

## Features

• Uses a functional programming style to implement the game's rules logic into the program
• The list of 113,809 english words is stored in a text file on the server
• Validates that the word chosen by the player is one within the list of words
• Validates that the word chosen by the player uses only the randomly generated selection of letters
• Returns a game result and score displaying the winner
• Looks up the dictionary definition of the word using the Oxford English Dictionaries API
• There is no 30 second clock like there is on the actual game of Countdown. This is intended so that recruiters and hiring managers don't have to wait for a countdown timer to expire.
