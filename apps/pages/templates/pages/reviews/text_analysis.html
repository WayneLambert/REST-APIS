                The text analysis app is a demonstration of using Python to calculate the number of
                occurrences of each of the words and letters used within the string input/pasted by
                the user. No models are required for this app, however Django's views handles the
                request/response cycle and the rendering of the applicable context is handled using
                a Django template.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also some mathematical calculations for the rate of any given letter appearing
                within the text being evaluated.

            This was one of my earlier scripting projects that I completed before I ever started to
            build a Django portfolio in earnest. I added it to my Django portfolio at a later date
            and built upon it with additional polish features both from a refactoring of back end
            code perspective and improved presentation of the tables on the front-end.

        <!-- Project Approach / Solution -->
        <div class="project-section mb-5">
          <h3 class="section-title font-weight-bold mb-2" id="approach-and-solution">The Approach &amp; Solution</h3>
          <p>
            I started by thinking about the algorithm and approach to calculate the frequency of words
            and letters within the text block. It seemed reasonable to me that I would need to split
            the string into two operational lists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first would be a list of words that could be looped over and counted for their
            frequency of occurrence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second would be a list of letters that could be looped over and counted for their
            frequency of occurrence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next part would be to sort the lists in a logical order so that they could be
            rendered usefully to the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            For words, it made sense that the list should be sorted by frequency of occurrence.
            For letters, it made sense that the list should be sorted alphabetically.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project Evaluation -->
        <div class="project-section mb-5">

          <p>
            Following a refactor of the project, the code is now easier to understand and maintain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code has been extracted into a 'views.py' file where functions relating to the
            rendering of Django views lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remainder of the code are utility functions that have been moved into a separate
            module called 'utils.py'.
