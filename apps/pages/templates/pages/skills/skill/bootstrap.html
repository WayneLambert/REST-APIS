              I am proficient with the use of most Bootstrap components. I have
              used many of these within the various projects in my portfolio.
            </p>

              From hours of fiddly practice, I can layout webpages quickly with grid layouts
              and fine-tune HTML elements with margins, padding, and spacing to achieve
              the desired look of a page.
            </p>

              Together with using Boostrap for visual design, I can use icon libraries such as
              FontAwesome in addition to using custom svg icons from websites like
              <a href="https://iconify.design/" target="_blank">Iconify</a> or
              <a href="https://worldvectorlogo.com/" target="_blank">WorldVectorLogo</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to explore another CSS library, perhaps
              <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>, in a
              future project. It is a challenging consideration though because I know I
              will have to forgo learned efficiency in Bootstrap to style a project using
              Tailwind.
