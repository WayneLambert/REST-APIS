              This one perhaps comes as a bit of a surprise for web developers but I find
              that this one is perhaps overlooked. It is especially useful when
              you're working with an external API.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're using a standard Python Interpreter to inspect the JSON from an
              external API, you may be presented with one continuous block of code with no spacing,
              line breaks or formatting, then it makes it very difficult to see the matching
              bracket sets. Doing this inside a Jupyter notebook formats the code beautifully
              which makes this a breeze.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coupled with Jupyter's ability for documentation and to quickly replay the code,
              iterative development using an API is a pleasure with Jupyter notebooks.

              This is likely to be enhanced even further soon as the Python extension team at
              Microsoft are working on providing in-cell debugging and live variable inspection.
