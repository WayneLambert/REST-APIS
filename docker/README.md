# Docker Setup

This directory contains the Dockerfiles and associated configuration files to use the `docker-compose.yml` file for local development.

The deployment of this project on <https://waynelambert.dev> is on Heroku. The Dockerfile and `heroku.yml file` are within the root directory of the project.

The directory and files within the `prod` directory do not actually need to exist. They are merely there as an example for how an nginx configuration on a server such as Linode or Digital Ocean would work.
