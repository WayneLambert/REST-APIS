![Python Django Portfolio Blog](https://wl-portfolio.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/python-django-portfolio-github.png)

This site is hosted at <https://waynelambert.dev> and illustrates the use of Django apps to showcase Django, Python and other programming and web framework skills and technologies.

The blog is not intended to be a fully blown production product, therefore some typical blog features have been purposefully omitted. For example, comments and tags are additional features that could be developed for the blog.
