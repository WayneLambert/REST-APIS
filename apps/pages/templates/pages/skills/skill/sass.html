              I can create a project's CSS using Sass. I personally use `node-sass` to
              compile my Sass into CSS. I find this works much more quickly than
              VS Code's Live Sass Compiler.

              I can create variables and functions. I can separate the components of the
              project through partials and imports.

              I know many CSS attributes, although it's still a relatively small proportion of
              those available.

              My knowledge and skills in responsive design needs further work. Currently,
              it can take me a while to resolve responsive design issues between various
              devices and browsers. This is often a source of frustration for me in front-end development,
              although my gut feeling is that there is probably better tools out there to assist in making
              this development less painful.
