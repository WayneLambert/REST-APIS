              VS Code is my favourite bit of software and it goes from strength-to-strength
              month-on-month. I spend the majority of my development time here. My VS Code
              setup is much more like an IDE with circa 100 enabled extensions and a lot of
              custom config in my settings, keybindings, and launch json files.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thankfully, I have built a lot of "muscle memory" with many of the
              keyboard shortcuts which enables for efficient coding and debugging. The majority of
              my time is spent on focusing on a development problem rather than how to
              actually use the editor.
            </p>
            <p>
              I use it for anything from simple Markdown, to managing Docker containers, to
              autocompletion assistance with either Visual Studio Intellicode or TabNine.
              Also, there is an app called Sourcery which does a fantastic job of analysing
              your code and suggesting any refactorings that might improve code quality.
