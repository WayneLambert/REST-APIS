# Counting

The word/letter counting app is a demonstration of using Python to calculate the number of occurrences of each of the words and letters used within the string input/pasted by the user. No models are required for this app, however Django's views handles the request/response cycle and the rendering of the applicable context is handled using a Django template.

There is also some mathematical calculations which specify the rate if any given letter appearing within the text being evaluated.

To save time, uou can import some 'lorem ipsum' text instead of typing or copying/pasting.

## Features

- Uses Python lists to store results from logic
- Uses Pythonic for [each] looping to iterate over every letter of the alphabet to test for presence
- Creates a context dictionary with several elements used within the Django template to give the user rich information about the text they would like to examine

## Technologies Used

- Languages: Python, HTML / CSS
- Frameworks: Django, Bootstrap, FontAwesome
- Other: GitHub, Docker

**Data Protection Notice:** No data is recorded within the application and the text used does not appear in any analytics.
