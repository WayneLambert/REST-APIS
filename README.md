![Python Django Portfolio Blog](https://wl-portfolio.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/python-django-portfolio.png)

This is the code for my portfolio site hosted at
<https://waynelambert.dev>.

It is intended to showcase Django, Python, Postgres and other
programming and web framework skills and technologies.

The code is not intended to be cloned for reproduction as it's a
representation of my personal portfolio of work, therefore instructions
have not been provided to clone and set up.

Please feel free to take a look at the [open and closed
issues](https://github.com/WayneLambert/portfolio/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
as they're important representations of some of the issues encountered
and solutions used. This reflects the ongoing nature of problem solving
within software projects.
