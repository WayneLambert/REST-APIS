# [The Word Counting App](https://waynelambert.dev/count/check-count/)

The word counting app is a demonstration of using Python to calculate the number of occurrences of each of the words and letters used within the string input/pasted by the user. Again, no models are required for this app, however Django's view handles the request/response cycle and the rendering of the applicable context is handled using a Django template.

You can import some 'lorem ipsum' text instead of typing or copying/pasting. No data is recorded within the application and the text used does not appear in any analytics.
