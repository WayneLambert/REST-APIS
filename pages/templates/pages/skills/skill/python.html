              I have been learning Python since May 2018. Having studied many books and video courses 
              and built a variety of projects using the skills learned, I have used Python as a scripting language, developing on the web and analysing datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have used a variety of libraries within the Python Eco-system and have an extensive knowledge of the extended standard library.
              Amongst many others, I have a good working knowledge of libraries such as 
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/itertools.html#module-itertools">itertools</a>, 
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functools.html#module-functools">functools</a> 
              and 
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#module-collections">collections</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the need for some of the tools within these libraries are not always 
              required, it is useful to know them for when you would like to build more efficient code 
              or a standard data structure just doesn't give you the required functionality.
              You can see examples of me using Python for various scripts within 
              <a href="https://github.com/WayneLambert/library-python">my code library</a>. 
              A lot of the examples within the library are highly contrived academic examples 
              so to illustrate their usage.
