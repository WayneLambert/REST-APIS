              I build all of my project's development environments using Docker within the terminal.
              Other than 'build', 'up', and 'down', the majority of

              I can build 'docker-compose' files to automate the build and setup process
              for my Django projects. This includes services for Django itself, Postgres,
              Celery, CeleryBeat, and Redis.

              I have tested a lot of Python images and eventually found that
              some of the recommended lighter packages such as 'alpine' is actually
              more hassle than its worth. This is because you need to add/remove dependencies
              to get the images to build all for the sake of the overall build being that bit smaller.
              I have settled on the 'Buster' version which works for my projects.
