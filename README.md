> This site is hosted at <https://waynelambert.dev> and illustrates the use of Django apps to
> showcase Django, Python and other programming and web framework skills and technologies.

> The code is not intended to be cloned for reproduction as it is a representation of my personal
> portfolio of work, therefore instructions have not been provided to clone and set up.
>
> Please take a look at both the open and closed issues as they are important representations of
> issues encountered and solutions used, etc which reflect the ongoing nature of software projects.
>
> A quick note on PEP8. The code in this portfolio does not adhere to the guidelines of 79
> characters. My personal thoughts on this is that for personal projects, I use a flexible limit of
> 89 and a hard limit of 99 characters.
