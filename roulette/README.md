# Holiday Roulette

This code is for the procrastinating traveller that just can't decide where they
should go to next. There is a sleep of 1 second between each choice made by the
random selection so the traveller can watch the logging on the screen as if it
is a roulette wheel that decides their fate.

Increase the level of time.sleep() for the additional suspense factor. :)
