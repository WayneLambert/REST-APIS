              I am proficient in the command line for most of the basic and intermediate Git commands
              required to manage a project such as add, remove, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, status, diff, log.
              I would need to quickly look up some of the lesser used commands.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have made a few contributions to open source projects. These have mainly been in
              improving the documentation and testing coverage (tox/travis).

              I would like to learn more about GitHub Actions as this seems like the next
              progression in CI/CD since it's so closely coupled with GitHub. I haven't found
              a need to use this yet as my deployment strategy is using Heroku which, after
              the first deployment, is relatively simple when compared to deploying to a
              Linux server such as Linode or Digital Ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              I do use GitHub Actions to run test suites prior to deployment in addition to
              some housekeeping tasks within my repos.
