              I have used pytest exclusively as my testing framework of choice. I see very little
              reason to be using Python's built-in testing framework since the pytest API, community,
              and plugin ecosystem is so good.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to standard pytest, I have a good working knowledge of pytest-django,
              coverage, some mocking libraries such as factoryboy and mixer, and an evolving
              knowledge of hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to improve my knowledge of hypothesis more as I can see how extremely
              powerful it can be.

              Within this portfolio project, you can see many examples of testing of models, views, urls,
              and forms. Somewhat controversially, I also test the project's settings. To me, this seems
              like a sensible thing to do, although I appreciate many others disagree.
            </p>

              If you, or someone else on the team, changes a project setting which is imperative for the
              project to function correctly, they may not be aware of the breaking change. It might not even
              show up in the running of an extensive test suite. Some of the project's settings are in
              place for the front-end to function correctly. If there is a failing test for a setting,
              it at least prompts the question, "are you sure this project will continue to function
              as expected by changing this setting?" If the programmer is sure, they can always just
              change the test.

              In addition, and certaintly where I have control of an external site's 404 breakages,
              I test links to external websites. I learned this after a large restructuring exercise
              where I grouped apps into an 'apps' directory and ended up breaking a lot of the external
              links which should have enabled the user to navigate to the relevant source code page.
