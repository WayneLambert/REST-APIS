# Countdown Numbers Game

The countdown project uses the logic from the numbers game on Countdown to enable a player to play against Carol (the computer) attempting to get the closest number they can to the target.

## Features

- Uses a functional programming style to implement the game's rules logic into the program
- Validates that the calculation method used by the player is permitted
- Returns a game result and score displaying the winner
- Returns a calculation by Carol Vorderman which is as close as possible to the target number
- Unlike the TV game show, there is no 30 second clock. This is intended so that recruiters and hiring managers don't have to wait for a countdown timer to expire

## Rules

Here are the rules for the numbers game on the TV show, Countdown:

- Six, face-down, numbered tiles are selected from 24 shuffled tiles. The tiles are arranged into 2 groups:
  - **Large Numbers:** There are 4 numbers in the large set. These are 25, 50, 75 and 100
  - **Small Numbers:** There are 20 numbers in the small set. 2 each of the numbers 1-10
- One contestant selects between 0 and 4 numbers from the large set (a.k.a. from the top) and the remaining numbers are drawn from the small set to make six numbers in total
- A random three-digit target number is then generated by the computer
- The contestants are given 30 seconds to get as close as possible to the chosen target by using just the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, ×, and ÷).
- Brackets in the calculations are permitted and ordinary BODMAS operations apply
- Not all of the digits need to be used
- Concatenation of digits is not permitted (For example, you cannot use a “2” and “2” to make “22”)
- At no intermediate step in the process can:
  - the current running total become negative
  - the running total involve a fraction
- Each numbered tile can only be used once in the calculation

## The Scoring

- 10 points are awarded for correctly achieving a solution that meets the target number
- 7 points are awarded for getting within 5 of the target number
- 5 points are awarded for getting within 10 points of the target number
- Only the contestant whose solution is nearest to the the target scores
- Both contestants score if it is a draw

## Technologies Used

- Languages: Python, HTML / CSS
- Frameworks: Django, Bootstrap, FontAwesome
- Libraries: ast, itertools, operator, re, collections, random, urllib
- Other: GitHub, Docker
