> This code for this portfolio site is hosted at
> <https://waynelambert.dev> and is intended to showcase Django, Python,
> Postgres and other programming and web framework skills and
> technologies.
>
> The code is not intended to be cloned for reproduction as it's a
> representation of my personal portfolio of work, therefore
> instructions have not been provided to clone and set up.
>
> Please feel free to take a look at the [open and closed
> issues](https://github.com/WayneLambert/portfolio/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
> as they're important representations of some of the issues encountered
> and solutions used. This reflects the ongoing nature of software
> projects.
>
> A quick note on PEP8. The code in this portfolio does not adhere to
> the guideline of 79 characters per line. My approach for personal
> projects is to work to a flexible limit of 89 and a hard limit of 99
> characters. Docstrings are wrapped at 72 characters.
