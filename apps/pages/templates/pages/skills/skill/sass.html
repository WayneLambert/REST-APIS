              I can create a project's CSS using Sass. I personally use `node-sass` to
              compile my Sass into CSS. I find this works much more quickly than
              VS Code's Live Sass Compiler

              I can create variables and functions. I can separate the components of the
              project through partials and imports.

              I know many CSS attributes, although that is still a small proportion of those
              that are available.

              My knowledge and skills in responsive design needs further work. Currently,
              it can take me a while to resolve responsive design issues between various
              devices. This is often a source of frustration for me in front-end development.
