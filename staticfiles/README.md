# Purpose of 'Staticfiles' Folder

This folder is committed to source control for visibility of the static files used for the website. A 'static' or 'staticfiles' directory would not normally be submitted to source control for a production website, however the purpose of a portfolio is to demonstrate skill, therefore these have been left to show that the process of collecting the static files is undertaken.
