# Countdown Numbers Game

The countdown project uses the logic from the numbers game on Countdown to enable a player to play against the computer attempting to get the closest number they can to the target.

## Features

• Uses a functional programming style to implement the game's rules logic into the program
• Validates that the calculation method used by the player is permitted
• Returns a game result and score displaying the winner
• Returns a calculation by Carol Vorderman which is as close of possible to the target number
• There is no 30 second clock like there is on the actual game of Countdown. This is intended so that recruiters and hiring managers don't have to wait for a countdown timer to expire.

## Rules

All games require rules, here are the rules for the numbers game of Countdown:

- Six, face-down, numbered tiles are selected from twenty-four shuffled tiles.
- The tiles are arranged into two groups: Large Numbers and Small Numbers.
- There are four numbers in the large set. These are 25 , 50 , 75 and 100
- There are twenty numbers in the small set, two each of the numbers 1-10.
- One contestant selects as many numbers as desired (unseen) from the large set (between none and all four), and the balance are pulled from the small set to make six numbers in total.
- A random three-digit target number is then chosen by a computer*.
- The contestants are given 30 seconds to get as close as possible to the chosen target by using just the four basic arithmetic operators + - × ÷
- Not all the digits need to be used.
- Concatenation of the digits is not allowed (You can’t use a “2” and “2” to make “22”).
- At no intermediate step in the process can the current running total become negative or involve a fraction.
- Each numbered tile can only be used once in the calculation.
- 10 points are awarded for correctly getting the exact solution.
- 7 points are awarded for getting within 5 of the required solution.
- 5 points are awarded for getting within 10 points of the required solution.
