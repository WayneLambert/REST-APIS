              I am a proficient power-user of the terminal. The high majority of my
              terminal knowledge is in Mac and Ubuntu, so I wouldn't know that much
              in Windows. I know a lot of the commands are similar but don't know the
              differences between the operating systems. WSL somewhat compensates for
              that, however I much prefer to do my development on a Mac.
            </p>
            <p>
              To varying degrees, I can use the terminal for package management with tools
              like 'brew', 'pip', 'pipenv', 'conda', 'npm' and 'poetry'.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can create some shell scripts to automate some frequently repeated processes.
