# Agile

Agile is a set of **values and principles** that serve as a framework for developing or maintaining software.

## Flavours of Agile

The two main flavours of Agile are _Scrum_ and _Kanban_.

Agile is often an emotive topic whereby people have deep-seated beliefs about which flavour is the best. Often the opinions on the workflow flavours do not necessarily have any evidential foundation.

It is often cited that Kanban works well for service-oriented teams like IT, or any team fixing an ongoing stream of bugs being found, or fires that need to be put out. Scrum works well for teams building features/stories as part of a product to be released.

It seems to be commonly accepted that Scrum is better for "new and different" and Kanban is better for "business as usual"

### Team Scrum

The scrum team will often work on a two week sprint whereby they aim to move the items of work from the left side of the board to the right side of the board.

There will often be 4 columns to move the items from/to. These are:

To do --> Develop --> Test --> Release

By the Tuesday of the second week, the items should be in final development at the least and likely be in test ready for the release cycle.

#### Lessons in Scrum

1. Keep WIP under control. Have no more than 5 work items under any one heading.
2. Talk about the work, face-to-face where possible
3. Always be moving to the right
