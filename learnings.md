# Learnings

## Django / Python

- Viewsets can be used to make code tidy in cases where each of the HTTP methods will be used. Blog posts makes a good use case for this as it is likely that you would want to be able to create, read, update and delete blog posts.

## React / JavaScript

- Classes are used to define components by extending them
- JSX combines HTML and JavaScript to define the output within the Render method
- Axios is a library used to read data from my back ends API endpoint
- Ant is a styling library used for React (in a similar way to Bootstrap for HTML/CSS sites)
- Bootstrap can still be used within React and it needs the library installing
- Props is used to pass an object's code around React components so that it can be rendered
- The 'Map' function can be used to render a list of items as HTML elements
- The state needs to be set within a ComponentDidMount object
- A BrowserRouter (aliased as Router) can be used to render each of the items. For example, this could be to render each of the blog posts.
- Arrow functions should be used to make the code more readable and concise
