# Objectives

The objectives of this small project is to extract the results from an interesting public domain dataset in JSON format that I can use to analyse.

The inspiration and instruction to perform this project comes from Corey Schafer's YouTube tutorial on "How to Write Python Scripts to Analyze JSON APIs and Sort Results."

The process steps contained within will be as follows:

* Make a request to a public domain website
* Retrieve a response and save its JSON content
* Extract the parts of the JSON file that I need to fulfil the objectives
* Use the final JSON for the context for my REST API endpoint
* Pass the content through to React securely using appropriate permissions setup

The first website that I will use is the one demonstrated within the tutorial itself which is the Homebrew website (<https://brew.sh/>)
